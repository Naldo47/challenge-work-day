# Challenge Requirements
Create a work day scheduler
Displays the current day at the top of the calendar
Includes time blocks for standard business hours
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
The user can click into a time block to add/update an event
The user can click the save button and the event is saved into local storage
When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist

# How it Works
Make a calendar to represent the workday: 9AM-5PM.
The day is shown in hour time blocks.
Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it occurs in the past (gray), present (red) or future green.
Each time block has an input field and 'save' buttons.
Appointments can be entered to a specific hour inline, and the 'save' button saves them to local storage.
